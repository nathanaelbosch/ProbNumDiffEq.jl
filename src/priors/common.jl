    AbstractGaussMarkovProcess{elType}

Abstract type for Gauss-Markov processes.

Gauss-Markov processes are solutions to linear time-invariant stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). Here we assume SDEs of the form
```math
\begin{aligned}
dX_t &= F X_t dt + L dW_t \\
X_0 &= \mathcal{N} \left( X_0; \mu_0, \Sigma_0 \right)
\end{aligned}
```
where ``X_t`` is the state, ``W_t`` is a Wiener process, and ``F`` and ``L`` are matrices.

Currently, ProbNumDiffEq.jl makes many assumptions about the structure of the SDEs that it
can solve. In particular, it assumes that the state vector ``X_t`` contains a range of
dervatives, and that the Wiener process only enters the highest one. It also assumes a
certain ordering of dimensions and derivatives. This is not a limitation of the underlying
mathematics, but rather a limitation of the current implementation. In the future, we hope
to remove these limitations.

!!! warning
    We currently strongly recommended to not implement your own Gauss-Markov process by
    subtyping this type! The interface is not yet stable, and the implementation is not yet
    sufficiently documented. Proceed at your own risk.

This is not the dimension of the "state" that is used to efficiently model the prior
process as a state-space model, but it is the dimension of the process itself that we aim
to model.

This implementation is likely to change in the future to allow for more flexibility.

"""
    SciMLBase.remake(::AbstractGaussMarkovProcess{T}; eltype=T, kwargs...)

Create a new process of the same type, but with different parameters.
This is particularly used to set the Wiener process dimension, so that the prior can be
defined with missing dimension first, and then have the dimension set to the dimension of
the ODE. This corresponds to having the same prior for all dimensions of the ODE.
Similarly, the element type of the process is also set to the element type of the ODE.

    initilize_transition_matrices!(p::AbstractGaussMarkovProcess)

Create all the (moslty empty) matrices that relate to the transition model.

The transition model (specified in `cache.prior`) is of the form
```math
X(t+h) \\mid X(t) \\sim \\mathcal{N} \\left( X(t+h); A(h) X(t), Q(h) \\right).
```
In addition, for improved numerical stability it computes preconditioning matrices ``P, P^{-1}`` as described in [1], as well as transition matrices
```math
\\begin{aligned}
A = P A(h) P^{-1}, \\\\
Q = P Q(h) P.\\\\
\\end{aligned}
```
This function creates matrices `A`, `Q`, `Ah`, `Qh`, `P`, `PI` to hold all these quantities, and returns them.
The matrices will then be filled with the correct values later, at each solver step, by calling [`make_transition_matrices`](@ref).

The preconditioning matrices and the preconditioned state transition matrices are saved in `cache.P, cache.PI, cache.A, cache.Q`.`

Note that `cache` would typically be an `EKCache`, but the function also works for any type that has fields `Ah, Qh, A, Q, P, PI`.
