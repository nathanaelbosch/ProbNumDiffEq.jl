    initilize_transition_matrices!(p::AbstractODEFilterPrior)

Create all the (moslty empty) matrices that relate to the transition model.

The transition model (specified in `cache.prior`) is of the form
```math
X(t+h) \\mid X(t) \\sim \\mathcal{N} \\left( X(t+h); A(h) X(t), Q(h) \\right).
```
In addition, for improved numerical stability it computes preconditioning matrices ``P, P^{-1}`` as described in [1], as well as transition matrices
```math
\\begin{aligned}
A = P A(h) P^{-1}, \\\\
Q = P Q(h) P.\\\\
\\end{aligned}
```
This function creates matrices `A`, `Q`, `Ah`, `Qh`, `P`, `PI` to hold all these quantities, and returns them.
The matrices will then be filled with the correct values later, at each solver step, by calling [`make_transition_matrices`](@ref).

See also: [`make_transition_matrices`](@ref).
