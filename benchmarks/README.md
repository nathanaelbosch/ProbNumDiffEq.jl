# Benchmarks

To see the results, have a look at the Benchmarks section in the [documentation](https://nathanaelbosch.github.io/ProbNumDiffEq.jl/dev/).

## How to run the benchmarks

You can generate interactive notebooks by running
```julia
using Weave
notebook("multi-language-wrappers.jmd")
```
where you can replace `multi-language-wrappers.jmd` with the benchmark of your choice.

The markdown files from the documentation are generated with `runall.jl`
